yesterday i was gonna present a session to all of you guys but there is a catch in this > things took a drastic turn i could not deliver what i intended to deliver yesterday > things did not go the way i expected > i don't know when i will get a chance to present to you guys again > i will to try make that moment happen again soon > but this time it will be daam intresting and knowledge and will make sure that you guys gain pure knowledge about llm's and current situation of ai.

the purpose of yesterdays session was to explain you : what is ai, what are the types of ai , current trends of ai , what is generative ai , what are the job opening in ai , and the final boss amongst them was LLM [large language models] which is type of ai that powers up the your chat bots of tech goliaths like open ai, google , microsoft etc etc, and also wanted to talk about the semiconductor chip shortage we are facing, who controls the chip market, hwo to train an llm, what all challenges we face, and what all things we require to train an ai model , the difference between open source model and closed source models and what is agi [advantages vs disadvantges], where the future of ai is heading and what all crazy things are going in silicon valley [https://scrollprize.org/] , what is preplixity ai and how it is going at direct war with google on search engines , what are gpu's,tpu's and,  why gpu's are preferred for ai models and their trainning.

i also had a small challenge for you guy > try to build jarvis > i know this may sound very complicated considering jarvis had emotions but i suggst you try 

the purpose of writing this was to share the links i presented yesterday so you guys can play and test yourself > these link was put together in short time > in coming time i will more things like these 

- https://lmsys.org/ > https://arena.lmsys.org/ > so this website is powered by great people who let common people use paid models like [chat gpt4, claude 3] to common people for free > must try > you can also have two model running side by side > 32 extremely powerful models are available here
- https://huggingface.co/models > this website is a heaven for people who want to try open source models [llama2, phi2] of tech giants like meta and microsoft > dont go for the big models go for quantized models > and make sure you have enough computational power for that 
- https://huggingface.co/chat/ > if you dont want to ai models locally you can try out some big models in > you can also switch the models if you want 
- https://www.perplexity.ai/ > these guys are bringing a revolution in the search engine market
- https://www.phind.com/search?home=true > a very powerful coding llm out there 
- https://groq.com/ > a super fast llm must faster that gpt3
- https://explorer.globe.engineer/ > new way of searching 
- https://techmeme.com/ > a place where you can read all the latest tech news > used by sunder pichai and zukerberg 
- https://huggingface.co/spaces/Xenova/the-tokenizer-playground?s=08 > a place where you can test tokenization of llms 
- https://rentry.org/llm-training > holy grail for llm training 
- https://mixtral.replicate.dev/?s=08 > very very powerful llm 
- https://www.gradio.app/ > a place where you can host your ai models 
- https://www.unstability.ai/ > an outcast > you have have heard about stable diffusion but what is unstable diffusion 
- https://www.kaggle.com/ > if you into training ml models then this is a heaven for you
